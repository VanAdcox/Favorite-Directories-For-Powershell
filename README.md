# Favorite-Directories-For-Powershell
Create favorite directories &amp; easily go to them with this simple powershell script

Open the fav.ps1 file & edit the conditions with the following format to create favorites:

```& { condition SHORTCUT FOLDER }```

You can use this as a standalone script by running:
```fav.ps1 SHORTCUT```
or you can add the directory to your PATH & run it anywhere with: 
```fav SHORTCUT```


Thank you to [@vitalyb](https://medium.com/@vitalyb) on Medium for inspiring the script.
